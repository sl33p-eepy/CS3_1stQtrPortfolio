## Topics
1. CSS Styling - CSS is a simple and easy to use style of code that allows you to design and customize your HTML sites. You can group your HTML into parts and design/style each of these parts respectively in CSS
2. Loops - Loops simplify your code so that you can have a process repeated a certain number of times as much as you want. There are several ways to make a loop, and you can use whichever one works best for you! Some of these are "for", "while", and "do .. while" loops
3. Array - An easier way to list items and also allows you to group them however you want. It also makes coding these items easier since you only have to mention the array name when coding and not each item in the array specifically. Arrays can be edited by adding, removing, or changing the contents of it.
4. Functions - A block of code that you can call upon when needed. They can be hoisted. Function expressions can be stored in variables and are useful for passing functions as arguments.
5. Markdown - It's like taking notes on code. Organizing this is simple and easy to understand. You can make lists, add images, block-texts, and hyperlinks.
## Difficult Topics
1. Loops - They are easy to understand on their own, but it gets a bit confusing when the target output isn't as easy to comprehend so you don't know how you're supposed to make your loop
2. Functions - There are many ways to make functions depending on what kind of output you want so it gets kind of confusing from there.
3. JS Script in HTML - Javascript isn't a strict language and there are several ways to code however you want. Although its not as strict, this is also why it gets confusing. After studying several ways of coding a certain thing, you may get mixed up easily by the coding style you're following and end up with a half-baked code that doesn't do anything.
4. Nested Loops - Reiteration of the first one; loops can be confusing as is, and even more confusing when they are nested in each other.
5. CSS Styling - Not necessarily a topic I'm unfamiliar with but, I'd like to understand more how each 'style' works so I can do my best to make use of each property in designing my website/HTML.
## Plan of Action
1. I can improve on the topics listed above by practicing making various codes on CodeChef, and also try customizing my Portfolio Profile with CSS so I can improve and discover the style I enjoy doing most.
## Activities (Effective and Ineffective)
* Effective
1. Hangman Guessing Game - Base code was easy enough to understand and customizing and styling it was fun.
2. CSS HTML Bonus Activities - They were fun and already gave you a base code that you could personalize
* Ineffective
1. Coding Tasks - It was a bit difficult to figure out how to produce the desired output and when you do find a code that will work you aren't certain that you'll understand it.
